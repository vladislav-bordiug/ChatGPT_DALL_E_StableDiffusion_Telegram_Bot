## Start <a name = "start"></a>
When the user enters the start command, the bot sends him a welcome message stating that the user has free 3000 ChatGPT tokens, 3 DALL·E image generations and 3 Stable Diffusion image generations and displays 4 buttons: "💭Chatting — ChatGPT-4o", "🌄Image generation — DALL·E 3", "🌅Image generation — Stable Diffusion 3" and "👤My account | 💰Buy". If the user is already registered, the bot only displays buttons.

In [openaitools.py](app/services/openaitools.py) in the OpenAiTools class there are three parameters in the get_chatgpt function:

```model``` - The model which is used for generation.

```max_tokens``` - The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion.

```temperature``` - What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

## Account and buy <a name = "accountbuy"></a>
If the user wants to see account information or buy tokens and generations, he presses the "👤My account | 💰Buy" button. After pressing the button, the bot displays information about the rest of the user's ChatGPT tokens, DALL·E image generations and Stable Diffusion image generations. If the user wants to buy tokens and generations, he presses the "💰Buy tokens and generations" button, selects the product and currency. After that, the user needs to press the "💰Buy" button and pay in Crypto Bot if he wants to pay. If the user has paid, he should press "☑️Check" button and tokens or image generations will be added to his account. If the user hasn't paid, the bot will display the message "⌚️We have not received payment yet".

Payments are processed via webhooks (webhook url is specified in [Crypto Bot](https://t.me/send)).

```BASE_WEBHOOK_URL``` - Server URL

```DATABASE_URL``` - Database URL

## Database <a name = "database"></a>

This project requires a PostgreSQL database with two tables: users(user_id, username, chatgpt, dall_e, stable_diffusion), orders(invoice_id, user_id, product) and messages(id, user_id, role, content, messages). 

Users and information about them will be added to the "users" table, orders will be added to the "orders" table and ChatGPT context window messages will be added to the "messages" table.

Also this project requires a Redis database for aiogram’s FSMContext.

```DATABASE_URL``` - Database URL

```REDIS_URL``` - Redis URL

## How to deploy <a name = "howtodeploy"></a>

This project can be easily deployed on the [Railway](https://railway.app/) (if all variables are passed here and Postgres and Redis databases are created, BASE_WEBHOOK_URL is a free URL from Railway, DATABASE URL and REDIS_URL can be viewed in variables of created Postgres and Redis, use WEB_CONCURRENCY variable to set limit of workers on Railway).

It can be also deployed via [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) if all variables are passed into the [.env](.env) file.
```BASE_WEBHOOK_URL``` in this case can be obtained via ngrok.
